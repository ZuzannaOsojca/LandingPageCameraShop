        <h3>Choosing the Right Film:</h3>
            <h4> **Purpose:**</h4> 
            <p>Consider your photographic intent. Black and white films like Ilford HP5+ offer classic aesthetics, while color films like Kodak Portra are ideal for capturing vibrant scenes. For experimental photography, Lomography films like LomoChrome Purple provide a unique twist.</p>
            <h3 class="iso" id="iso">Film speed</h3>
           <p> Film speed is indicated by its ISO (International Organization for Standardization) rating. A higher ISO number signifies greater sensitivity to light, allowing for better performance in low-light conditions but often resulting in more noticeable grain. Here's a breakdown of different film ISO ratings with examples:</p>

<h3>ISO 100:</h3>
  <p>- **Characteristics:** Low sensitivity, fine grain. <br>
   - **Best Use:** Ideal for well-lit outdoor scenes, landscapes, and situations where fine detail is crucial.<br>
   - **Example Films:** Kodak Ektar 100 (ISO 100), Fujifilm Provia 100F (ISO 100), Kodak Portra 160 (ISO 160).</p>

<h3> ISO 200-400:</h3>
 <p>  - **Characteristics:** Balanced sensitivity, moderate grain.<br>
   - **Best Use:** Versatile for various lighting conditions, including outdoor and indoor settings.<br>
   - **Example Films:** Ilford HP5 Plus (ISO 400), Kodak Tri-X 400 (ISO 400), Fujifilm Superia X-Tra 400 (ISO 400).</p>

<h3>ISO 800-1600:</h3>
  <p>- **Characteristics:** Higher sensitivity, noticeable <br>
   - **Best Use:** Low-light conditions, fast action, or situations where you need a faster shutter speed.<br>
   - **Example Films:** Ilford Delta 800 (ISO 800), Kodak Portra 800 (ISO 800), Fujifilm Natura 1600 (ISO 1600).</p>

<h3>ISO 3200 and Above:</h3>
   <p>- **Characteristics:** Very high sensitivity, prominent grain.<br>
   - **Best Use:** Extreme low-light conditions, night photography, or capturing fast-paced action.<br>
   - **Example Films:** Ilford Delta 3200 (ISO 3200), Kodak T-MAX P3200 (ISO 3200), Fujifilm Neopan 1600 (ISO 1600).</p>

<p>Choosing the right ISO depends on the lighting conditions and the effect you want to achieve. Lower ISOs are great for detail and bright scenes, while higher ISOs are suitable for low light and fast-paced situations. Keep in mind that different films may have unique characteristics even within the same ISO range. Experimenting with various films will help you discover your preferred aesthetic.</p>
   
            <h3>Loading Film into Your Camera:</h3>
            <h4>**Read the Manual:** </h4> 
            <p>your camera manual for specific loading instructions. Different cameras may have slightly varying procedures.</p>
           <h4>**Loading in Darkness:**</h4> 
          <p> Load your film in a dark room or changing bag to prevent light leaks. If you're loading in daylight, cover the camera with a dark cloth.</p>
            <h4>**Advance the Film:**</h4> 
            <p> Advance the film until it stops. This ensures the film is correctly loaded and ready to shoot.</p>
            <h4>**Check for Tension:**</h4> 
           <p> Confirm the film is correctly threaded and feels taut. This prevents film slippage and ensures proper exposure.</p>
            <h4>**Close the Camera:**</h4>
        <P>Seal the camera back securely to prevent light leaks. Some cameras have a window to show the film canister, helping confirm proper loading.</P>
            
            <h3>By following these tips, you'll be well-equipped to choose the right film for your needs and load it into your camera with confidence. Happy shooting!</h3>
